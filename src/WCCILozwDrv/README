Driver Template

These files area a base framework for a new PVSS driver.
The tool newPVSSDriver in $API_ROOT creates a new driver project
by creating implementation files based on these files

What you have to do then is simply check all
// TODO
comments in the files and fill in your real implementations.

(Even without any modification you have already a compilable
 and runable new PVSS driver, which just sits there doing
 nothing ...)

To install copy the compiled Driver
into your projects "bin" directory

Enjoy!
